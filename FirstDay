1) Try Go in https://play.golang.org

2) Key point:
   >> Every Go file has to begin with a package declaration.
   >> Go files must import only the packages they reference. 
   >> Your program looks for a function named main to run first.
   >> fmt.Println function
   >> math.Floor function
   >> strings.Title function
  
3) SampleCode_01

4) Runes are kept as numeric codes, not the characters themselves, and if you pass a rune to fmt.Println, you'll see that numeric code in the output, not the original character.

5) Go is statically typed, which means that it knows what the types of your values are even before your program runs.
