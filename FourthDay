1) package import path and package name
    math/rand.Intn(), One is the package's import path(math), and the other is the package's name(rand).
    When we say math/rand we're referring to the package's import path, not its name. 
    By convention, the last (or only) segment of the import path is also used as the package name.
2) Increase randomness
    seconds := time.Now().Unix()
    rand.Seed(seconds)
    target := rand.Intn(100) + 1
3) strconv package's Atoi (string to integer)
4) loops:
   for x := 2; x < 5; x++ {}
5) note the else's position in the structure if/else if
6) continue and break in the loop 
7) Unlike most programming languages, Go allows multiple return values from a function or method call.
