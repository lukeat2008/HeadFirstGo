1) Input from the keyboard is read in as a string.
2) The input string still has a newline character on the end, from when the user pressed the Enter key while entering it. 
   Use the strings package's TrimSpace function to strip that off.
3) Use the strconv package's ParseFloat function to convert it to a float64 value.
4) ParseFloat returns a second error value, which will be nil unless there was some problem converting the string.
5) input, error  = strconv.ParseFloat(input, 64) is a Wrong statement
6) Each variable you declare has a scope: a portion of your code that it's "visible" within.
7) Difference between = and :=
